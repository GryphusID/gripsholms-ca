# Gryphus Gripsholms CA

Gryphus Gripsholms CA is an open-source public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificate authority (CA) software, based on ejbca-ce, adding support for Edward curves and new security features.


Gryphus Gripsholms CA covers all your needs – from certificate management, registration and enrollment to certificate validation. 

Gryphus Gripsholms CA is based on EJBCA (that is one of the longest running CA software projects, providing time-proven robustness, reliability and flexibitlity). It is platform independent and can easily be scaled out to match the needs of your PKI requirements, whether you’re setting up a national eID, securing your industrial IoT platform or managing your own internal PKI for Enterprise or DevOps.
